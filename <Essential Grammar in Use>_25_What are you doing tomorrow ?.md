# 现在时表将来时（现在进行时，表达计划或安排）

## A
We also use ***am/is/are + -ing*** for the *future* (tomorrow / next week etc):
* Andrew ***is playing*** tennis tomorrow.
* I'***m*** not ***working*** next week.

## B
***I am doing something tomorrow*** = I have arranged to do it, I have a plan to do it:
* Sophie ***is going*** to the dentist on Friday.(= she has an appointment with the dentist)
* We'***re having*** a party next weekend.
* ***Are*** you ***meeting*** your friends tonight?

## C
We use the present continuous(***I'm staying*** / ***are you coming*** etc.) to say what somebody has arranged to do:
* I'***m staying*** at home this evening. (not I say)
* ***Are*** you ***going*** out tonight? (not Do you go)

But we use the present simple (***start***,***arrives*** etc.) for timetables, programmes, trains, buses etc.:
* The train ***arrives*** at 7.30.
* What time ***does*** the film ***finish***?

Compare:
| *present continuous* ( usually for people) | *present simple* (for timetables, programmes etc) |
| - | - |
| I'***m going*** to a concert tomorrow. | The concert ***starts*** as 7.30. |
| What time ***are*** you ***leaving***? | What time ***does*** your train ***leave***? |
