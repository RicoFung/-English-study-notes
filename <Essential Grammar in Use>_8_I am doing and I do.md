We do not use these verbs in the present continuous (**I am -ing**)
```
like
want 
know 
understand 
remember
prefer
need 
mean 
believe 
forget
```
Use only the present simple with these verbs(I **want** / **do you like?** etc.):
* I'm tired, I **want** to go home.
* '**Do** you **know** that girl?' 'Yes,but I **don't remember** her name.'
* I **don't understand**. What **do** you **mean**?
